I'm Stephan, a final year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and the Vector Institute under the supervision of Prof. Nicolas Papernot. I work on trustworthy machine learning, most notably uncertainty quantification, selective prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization/robustness.
