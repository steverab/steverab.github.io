	<p>I am Stephan, a recent Computer Science Master's graduate from <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/">Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen (TUM)</a>. In addition to my main studies, I also studied Technology Management at the <a href="http://cdtm.de/">Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM)</a>, an interdisciplinary honours study program. </p>
	<p>I am currently specializing in a sub-area of Artificial Intelligence called Machine Learning, where I am especially interested in statistical robustness, uncertainty quantification (through Bayesian methods), learning from non-i.i.d. data, as well as safety implications, reliability, and interpretability of ML systems. Recently, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> working on my Master's thesis together with <a href="http://zacklipton.com">Prof. Zachary Lipton</a>. As part of this work, we were evaulating and developing methods for detecting and quantifying shifts in the data distribution between source and target environments.</p>
	<p>Right now, I am an Intern Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs working on systematically assessing the impact of input/output representations for deep-learning-based time-series forecasting and on identifying such representations which robustly provide good performance.</p>
	<p>Aside from technology, science, software development, and entrepreneurship, I am also interested in UI/UX design, architecture, and aviation.</p>
