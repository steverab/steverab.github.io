<p>I am Stephan, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a Machine Learning Researcher at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning. In particular, I am interested in making machine learning algorithms more reliable in real-world scenarios. As such, I mostly focus on uncertainty quantification methods, detection of anomalous/out-of-distribution data, robustness to distributional shifts, causality, and representation learning.</p>
