  <p>I am Stephan, a Computer Science Master's student at <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/">Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen (TUM)</a>. In addition to my main studies, I am also studying Technology Management at the <a href="http://cdtm.de/">Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM)</a>, an interdisciplinary honours study program. </p>
  <p>During my current studies, I am specializing in a sub-area of Artificial Intelligence called Machine Learning. Right now, I am a Visiting Research Scholar at <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> working on my Master's thesis together with <a href="http://zacklipton.com">Prof. Zachary Lipton</a>. As part of this work, we are evaulating current and developing new methods for detecting and quantifying shifts in the data distribution between training and testing environments.</p>
  <p>Aside from technology, science, software development, and entrepreneurship, I am also interested in UI/UX design, architecture, and aviation.</p>
